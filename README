	ABOUT
*******************************************
comiclib - by Reuben Castelino (projectdelphai@gmail.com)
Written in Ruby, this program is meant to be a lightweight and fast comic organizer and reader
The first part of it (tfo) will organize, rename, and move all comics to a designated folder. The 
second part (tfr) will scan all the titles, add it to a database, and allows you to read them using
sxiv, a lightweight image viewer following vim shortcuts.
	
*******************************************
	SETUP
*******************************************

1. The mysql daemon must be started before the comiclib reader can be used.
3. To use comiclib reader for the first time, ONLY on the first time run it as "comiclib --firstrun"
4. Config folder settings
  * all configs follow this format => :SETTING: VALUE
  * all paths do NOT end with a forward slash
  a. comicsdir - Overall library path, contains all comics
  b. origdir - Source directory of unsorted comics
  . mysqluser - user account name
  d. mysqlpass - user account password
		* This is the only config that can be left blank
5. tfo should be considered experimental and there might be exceptions that break the moving process. 
    * Be forewarned that multiple files can be moved at once and will need tracking down. Any tfo processing
	  should be done under supervision and not under a cron job until stable.

*******************************************
	FUTURE PLANS
*******************************************

* optionsgui
* comicvine synopsis in info window
* add better error messages 
	* for wrong mysql password
* Add a rename only config
* add developer configurations
